## User-Created Configuration

Configuration files (`config.yml`) authored by users using this software,
including profile definitions, path globs, git identities, and `gh` CLI
account references, are the intellectual property of their respective
creators. This license applies only to the gospelo-identity software itself,
not to the configuration content produced by or for it.

## External Tools and Credentials

This software invokes external tools (`git`, `gh` CLI) on the user's behalf
to read and modify local repository configuration and to switch GitHub
account contexts. The developers of gospelo-identity make no representations
or warranties regarding the behavior of these external tools or the safety of
the credentials they manage. Users are solely responsible for:

- Reviewing the planned changes before running `switch` (use `--dry-run` to
  preview, or run `check` first to confirm the target profile)
- Managing GitHub authentication credentials (`gh auth login`) and the
  scope/lifetime of access tokens in accordance with applicable laws,
  regulations, GitHub's terms of service, and their own security policies
- Any commits, pushes, releases, or other actions performed under the GitHub
  account selected by `switch`

## No Account Verification

gospelo-identity verifies that the locally configured git identity and `gh`
CLI active account match the user-declared profile for the current working
directory. It does **not** verify ownership of the GitHub account, employer
authorization, or any contractual obligations. Selecting a profile does not
grant any rights the user does not already hold. Users are solely responsible
for ensuring they have the right to publish under each configured account.
